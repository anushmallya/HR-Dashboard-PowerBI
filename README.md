# HR Dashboard using Power BI
A visually interactive dashboard built with Power BI that analyzes HR metrics like employee demographics, hiring trends, and salary patterns.

## 📌 Project Summary
This project was inspired by a Tableau-based HR dashboard tutorial on the "Data with Baraa" YouTube channel. Instead of replicating it in Tableau, I recreated the dashboard using **Power BI** and my own HR dataset generated through **Python scripting**.

## 📊 Dashboard Views

### 🔹 Summary View
- **Overview**: Total hires, active & terminated employees over time, by department, job title, HQ vs branches, and by city/state.
- **Demographics**: Gender ratios, age groups, education levels, and performance rating correlations.
- **Income**: Salary comparisons by gender and education level; salary trends by age across departments.

### 🔹 Employee Records View
- Filterable table with individual details: name, age, gender, education, department, position, and salary.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard design, visuals, bookmarks
- **DAX** – Custom calculations (basic)
- **Power Query** – Data transformations
- **Python (Pycharm)** – Generated dummy HR data
- **PowerPoint & Paint** – Created icons and dashboard buttons

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Data storytelling & dashboard design
- DAX fundamentals
- Structuring data models for analytics
- Building interactive reports using slicers, bookmarks, drill-throughs
- Deriving insights from workforce data (e.g., gender hiring balance, salary by location)

## 📈 Outcome
This project enhanced my **analytical thinking, dashboard structuring**, and understanding of **insight-driven storytelling** using Power BI. It demonstrated how planning data models in advance improves dashboard clarity and user experience.
